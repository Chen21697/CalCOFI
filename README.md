# ML Regression Practice

<p>This project is a practice based on professor Hung-Yi Lee's ML lecture. Given an input Salinity, it predicts the temperature based on the learned function.
<br>
<br> There are two different version, the first one is linear regression whose model is <strong>y = wx+b</strong>. Another one is still regression but with relatively more complicated model <strong> y = b + w1x + w2(x)^2</strong>. The optimizer in this project is Adagrad.
